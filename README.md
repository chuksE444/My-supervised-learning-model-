Stroke Risk Prediction App

This project is a machine learning application that predicts the risk of stroke based on patient data such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and other health features. The app uses a trained model, built with Python and scikit-learn, and is deployed using Streamlit.

Features

 # Input patient details and receive a predicted stroke risk.

 # Uses feature-engineered inputs for more accurate predictions.

 # Model trained and tested with careful handling of class imbalance (SMOTE applied).
